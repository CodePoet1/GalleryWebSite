	  <b>E. Anthony Orme B.S.P., F.I.G.A., B.G.A.P. </b>was born in Manchester, England, 
	  in 1945.  He Studied Life and Still Life at the Manchester College of Art and Design, 
	  later	qualifying as a hand engraver and etcher.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It was apparent from a very early stage that he was a naturally skilled artist
	  and he continally applied these skills whilst endlessly searching for technique
	  and perfection to personalise his style of painting.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Anthony travels world-wide in his pursuit of new and exciting work.  The light which
	  eminates from his paintings of southern France is a refreshing realism, whilst his
	  Parisian cafe scenes bring a touch of nostalgic impressionism.
	</p>
	<p>
	  He also produces paintings of British scenes (modern and nostalgic). He works from
	  his Manchester studio, where he produces pastels and oils of nudes, semi-nudes and
	  his much sort after ballerinas.
