Problem I need to resolve;	
1. To build a web site for AnthonyOrme gallery to show paintings and prints for sale.  
2. Be able to upload new paintings and prints into named galleries, this must be accomplished through a user interface without having to interact with the database directly.  
3. Buyers should be able to order an pay on line using credit card.  When a purchase is made emails are sent to the site administrators
4. Collect buyers contact details for future marketing
5. Provide logging facilities for user access and gain stats for how many access and where from



ToDo	   
1. Create gallery system that shows each gallery as a tiled web page, each tile being one of the galleries
2. Click on a gallery to show the paintings in that gallery as a tiled web page.  Each tile has a picture with each of the buying options and prices below it, e.g "Original Oil Â£3000 []"
3. Click on a picture to show picture in full size 
4. Click on the buying option to add to a cart
5. check out in the cart to buy a picture and send to the site Admin
